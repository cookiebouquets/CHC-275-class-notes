Today we will continue our discussion on multiple files and importing

For juniors: Course Recommendations are live, see me if you wish to discuss next year for 277 or 280.


277: Introduction to Computer Algorithms 

    This class is basically CMSC 202 + very basic CMSC 341 at UMBC, will be taught in either Java or C++. Will cover 
    object oriented design, asymptotic analysis (at a deeper level than this course will provide),
    very basic data structures (linkedlists, binary trees) and algorithms (breadth first, depth first, greedy). 
    This class will be very good for those going on to study Computer Science or any CS related field in college, 
    you will learn a lot of very advanced topics a lot earlier than you will see them in college 
    and will set you up for success in the difficult courses in those degree programs. 
    
    I'd recommend this course to the extremely motivated.

280: Cybersecurity Essentials

    This class is getting a redesign next year. It will basically follow this plan:
    
    1st semester will be all on computer networks and protocols, teaching you the language of information
    technology. 
    
    2nd semester will then be on practical cybersecurity based on the concepts you learned in the first
    semester, i.e. you need to be familiar with the vocabulary and concepts in a perfect setting
    before you learn about what vulnerabilities are possible.
    
    I'd recommend this course to either Prep B guys are people looking for a lower stakes elective.
