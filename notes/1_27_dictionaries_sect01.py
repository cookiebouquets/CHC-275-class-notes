    Today we'll be covering dictionaries. 
    
    From now on I'll be doing what is called live coding. Rather than making slides,
    I will write my notes as comments in a python file so that you can see running  code alongside 
    my annotated notes. 
    
    I have also made a github repo for the class. You can find all lab templates and notes there. 
    The link was messaged to you on blackbaud.

    Some Announcements: Tomorrow in day 2, I'm going to release lab 5. It's going to be about the
